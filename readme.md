# Features implemented for part 4

- sky periodically changes colors
- trees periodically change colors
- animated (and recreated) clouds
- monkeys oscillate from tree to tree
- monkeys have different movement patterns

These are the features I implemented, broken down by category.

## Animation and recreation
Clouds are continuously moving horizontally across the screen, and monkeys are swinging around the trees.
- clouds
- monkeys

## Different kinds of motion
Monkeys swing around the landscape, requiring sinusoidal position updates in the x and y directions.
- monkeys oscillate up and down
- some monkeys oscillate side to side

## Creature or landscape periodically change colors
The background changes colors depending on the time of day. Objects, and the sky, get darker at night.
